# changepoint-detection
Code accompanying the paper "Epidemic changepoint detection in the presence of nuisance changes", by Julius Juodakis and Stephen Marsland.
Includes implementations of the methods presented there, and the code for replicating simulations and real data analyses.

# How to use
Algorithms 1 and 2, described in the paper, are found in `MAIN-algorithm.R`.
Check out `example.R` for a minimal usage example.

Some functions that might be helpful for customizing the method are provided in `EXTRAS-algorithm.R`.
